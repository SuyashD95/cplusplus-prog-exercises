Create a base class called shape. Use this class to store two double type values that could be used to compute the area
of figures. Derive two specific classes called triangle and rectangle from the base shape. Add to the base class, a
member function get_data() to initialize base class data members and another member function display_area() to compute
and display the area of figures. Make display_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function in the derived
classes to suit their requirements.

Using these three classes, design a program that will accept dimensions of a triangle or a rectangle interactively, and
display the area.

Remember the two values given as input will be treated as lengths of two sides in the case of rectangles, and as base
and height in the case of the triangles, and used as follows:

Area of rectangle = x * y Area of triangle = 1/2 * x * y
